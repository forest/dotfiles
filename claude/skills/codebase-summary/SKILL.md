# Codebase Summary

## Overview

This sop analyzes a codebase and generates comprehensive documentation including structured metadata files that describe the system architecture, components, interfaces, and workflows. It can create targeted documentation files like AGENTS.md (README for AI agents), README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, or generate a complete documentation ecosystem. The documentation is organized to make it easy for AI assistants to understand the system and help with development tasks.

## Troubleshooting

### Large Codebase Performance
For very large codebases that take significant time to analyze:
- You SHOULD provide progress updates during analysis
- You SHOULD suggest focusing on specific directories or components if performance becomes an issue
- Consider running with consolidate=false to generate individual files faster

### Update Mode Issues
If update mode fails to detect changes correctly:
- Check if git history is available and accessible
- Try running with update_mode=false to generate fresh documentation

### Consolidation Issues
If consolidation fails or produces poor results:
- Check that consolidate_prompt provides clear guidance for the target file type
- Verify that all source documentation files were generated successfully
- Consider using a more specific consolidate_prompt for better results

### Missing Documentation Sections
If certain aspects of the codebase are not well documented:
- Check the review_notes.md file for identified gaps
- Consider running with check_completeness=true to identify missing areas
- Review the codebase analysis to ensure all components were properly identified

### Git Integration Problems
If git commands fail during update mode:
- Ensure the codebase_path is within a valid git repository
- Check that git is installed and accessible
- Verify that the user has appropriate permissions to read git history
