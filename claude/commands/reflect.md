# RETROSPECTIVE WORKFLOW

1. Examine the conversation thus far.
2. Self analyze where you went wrong and where you could have been better.
3. Ask the user for additional feedback.
4. Propose updates to rules files like AGENTS.md
5. Propose ways that the user could have prompted you better, or assisted better while working.
